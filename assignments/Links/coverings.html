    <center><h1>Brain Coverings: Meninges</h1></center>

    <p>Three layers of protective covering called meninges surround the brain and the spinal cord.

       <h3>Dura meter</h3> The outermost layer, the dura mater, is thick and tough. It includes two layers: The periosteal layer of the dura mater lines the inner dome of the skull (cranium) and the meningeal layer is below that. Spaces between the layers allow for the passage of veins and arteries that supply blood flow to the brain.
        <h3>Arachnoid</h3>The arachnoid mater is a thin, weblike layer of connective tissue that does not contain nerves or blood vessels. Below the arachnoid mater is the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. This fluid cushions the entire central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and continually circulates around these structures to remove impurities.
        <h3>Pia matar</h3>The pia mater is a thin membrane that hugs the surface of the brain and follows its contours. The pia mater is rich with veins and arteries.</p>

        <h2 id="space">Space between brain coverings</h2>

        <p>The subdural space is a space between your dura mater and your arachnoid mater. Under normal conditions, this space isn't a space, but can be opened if there's trauma to your brain (such as a brain bleed) or other medical condition. The subarachnoid space is a space between your arachnoid mater and pia mater.</p>

        <h2 id="function">Function of the brain</h2>

        <p>Meninges provide support and protection to the central nervous system. It also connect the brain and spinal cord to the skull and spinal canal. The major function of meninges is that, it produces cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid act as a shock absorber.</p>

        <h2 id="first">Dura Matar</h2>

        <p>The dura mater is the outermost layer of the meninges and is located directly underneath the bones of the skull and vertebral column. It is thick, tough, and inextensible.

            The dura mater consists of two layered sheets of connective tissue:
            
            Periosteal layer – lines the inner surface of the bones of the cranium.
            Meningeal layer – located deep to the periosteal layer. It is continuous with the dura mater of the spinal cord.
            The dural venous sinuses are located between the two layers of dura mater. They are responsible for the venous drainage of the cranium and empty into the internal jugular veins.
            
            The dura mater receives its own vascular supply – primarily from the middle meningeal artery and vein. It is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (V1, V2 and V3).</p>

            <h2 id="second">Arachnoid Mater</h2>
            <p>The arachnoid mater is the middle layer of the meninges, lying directly underneath the dura mater. It consists of layers of connective tissue, is avascular, and does not receive any innervation.

                Underneath the arachnoid is a space known as the sub-arachnoid space. It contains cerebrospinal fluid, which acts to cushion the brain. Small projections of arachnoid mater into the dura (known as arachnoid granulations) allow CSF to re-enter the circulation via the dural venous sinuses.

                <h2 id="third">Pia Mater</h2>

                <p>The pia mater is located underneath the sub-arachnoid space. It is very thin, and tightly adhered to the surface of the brain and spinal cord. It is the only covering to follow the contours of the brain (the gyri and fissures).

                    Like the dura mater, it is highly vascularised, with blood vessels perforating through the membrane to supply the underlying neural tissue.</p>
