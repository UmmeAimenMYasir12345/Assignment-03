    <center><h1>Basic information of Brain</h1></center>
    <h1>Brain</h1>

    <p>The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system, or CNS.</p>

    <h2>Why is it called brain</h2>

    <p>First phren (“mind” and “thought” are only some of its meanings; compare Engl. frenetic “frantic, frenzied”) was suggested, then bregma “top of the head; fontanel.” The brain-bregma etymology proved long-lived, and 19th-century researchers tried to reinforce it.</p>

    <h2>Colour of the brain</h2>

    <p>The human brain color physically is white, black, and red-pinkish while it is alive and pulsating. Images of pink brains are relative to their actual state. The brains seen in movies exhibit white, gray, and yellow shadows because they are disconnected from the blood and oxygen flow.</p>

    <h2>Discovery of brain</h2>

    <a href="./working.html#power">Know about power of brain</a>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>In ancient Greece, Alcmaeon of Croton (sixth-fifth century BC) recognizes the brain as a central organ responsible for higher activities such as intelligence, memory, and thought.</p>

    <h2>INformation of brain</h2>

    <a href="./coverings.html#layers">Know about layers of brain</a>


    <p>Recent estimates have suggested that the brain contains anywhere between 86 billion to 100 billion neurons. The brain, along with the spinal cord, constitutes the central nervous system. It is responsible for thoughts, interpretation and origin of control for body movements.</p>

    <h2>protection of brain</h2>

    <p>The brain is protected by the bones of the skull and by a covering of three thin membranes called meninges. The brain is also cushioned and protected by cerebrospinal fluid. This watery fluid is produced by special cells in the four hollow spaces in the brain, called ventricles.</p>

    <h2 id="mystery">Mystery about brain</h2>

    <p>If you ask Christof Koch, Ph.D., Chief Scientist and President of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, how close we are to understanding our own brains, he scoffs.

    “We don’t even understand the brain of a worm,” Koch said.
    
    The lab roundworm, more technically known as Caenorhabditis elegans, houses 302 neurons and 7,000 connections between those neurons in its microscopic body. Researchers have painstakingly mapped and described all those connections in recent years. And we still don’t fully understand how they all work synergistically to give rise to the worm’s behaviors.
    
    We humans have approximately 86 billion neurons in our brains, woven together by an estimated 100 trillion connections, or synapses. It’s a daunting task to understand the details of how those cells work, let alone how they come together to make up our sensory systems, our behavior, our consciousness.
    
    We asked Koch and his neuroscience colleagues to reflect on how much we still don’t know about the brain, and how these researchers are trying to solve those mysteries.</p>

    <h2 id="facts">Facts about brain</h2>

    <p>Sixty percent of the human brain is made of fat. ...
        Your brain isn't fully formed until age 25. ...
        Your brain's storage capacity is considered virtually unlimited. ...
        Brain information travels up to an impressive 268 miles per hour. ...
        On average, your spinal cord stops growing at 4 years old.</p>

        <h2 id="shape">Shape of brain</h2>

        <a href="./about.html#structure">Also know about structure of brain</a>

        <p>Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord. The tube flexes as it grows, forming the crescent-shaped cerebral hemispheres at the head.</p>

        <h2 id="weight">Weight of brain</h2>

        <p>On average, an adult brain weighs between 1.0 kg – 1.5 kg.  It is mainly composed of neurons – the fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system. Recent estimates have suggested that the brain contains anywhere between 86 billion to 100 billion neurons.</p>

        <h2 id="location">Location of brain</h2>

        <a href="./parts.html#large">Know about parts of brain</a>

        <p>The brain is enclosed within the skull, which provides frontal, lateral and dorsal protection. The skull consists of 22 bones, 14 of which form the facial bones and the remaining 8 form the cranial bones. Anatomically, the brain is contained within the cranium and is surrounded by the cerebrospinal fluid.

            The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is a fluid that circulates within the skull and spinal cord, filling up hollow spaces on the surface of the brain. Every day, the specialised ependymal cells produce around 500mL of cerebrospinal fluid.
            
            The primary function of the CSF is to act as a buffer for the brain, cushioning mechanical shocks and dampening minor jolts. It also provides basic immunological protection to the brain.
            
            Furthermore, CSF provides buoyancy for the brain. i.e., the brain is suspended in a layer of CSF, wherein, the weight of the brain is nearly negated. If the brain is not suspended in CSF, it would be impeded by its weight, consequently cutting off the blood supply in the lower half of the brain. It would lead to the death of neurons in the affected area.</p>
