    <center><h1>About brain</h1></center>
    <p>Weighing about 3 pounds in the average adult, the brain is about 60% fat. The remaining 40% is a combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts. The brain itself is a not a muscle. It contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells.</p>

    <h2>Development of brain</h2>

    <p>The brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages.[71] It changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain stem cells, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.[71]</p>

    <h2>What is the gray matter and the white matter</h2>
    <p>Gray and white matter are two different regions of the central nervous system. In the brain, gray matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath. In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: The white matter is on the outside, and the gray matter sits within.</p>

    <h2>Is brain a organ</h2>

    <p>The brain is an organ composed of nervous tissue that commands task-evoked responses, movement, senses, emotions, language, communication, thinking, and memory. The three main parts of the human brain are the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem.</p>

    <h2 id="Scientific">Scientific name of the brain</h2>

    <p>The cerebrum, which forms the major portion of the brain, is divided into two major parts: the right and left cerebral hemispheres. The cerebrum is a term often used to describe the entire brain.</p>

    <h2 id="classify">Classification about brain</h2>

    <p>The nervous system in humans can be broadly classified into two types, namely, the peripheral nervous system and central nervous system</p>

    <h2 id="definition">Definition about Central nervous system</h2>

    <p>The central nervous system primarily consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The system coordinates and controls various aspects of life, ranging from physical attributes (heartbeat, breathing) to mental capabilities (memory, intelligence).</p>

    <h2 id="computation">Computation of brain</h2>

    <p>If understanding the brain’s makeup is a challenge, figuring out how those billions of components come together to enable all the brain’s complex behavior is even more difficult. The Allen Brain Observatory team aims to capture a small part of that complexity: how a mammal’s brain represents and processes visual information.

        Neuroscientists have been studying the visual part of the mammalian brain for decades, but until very recently technology only allowed them to capture information from a handful of neurons at a time. It’s like if you tried to watch a movie but could only see 1000 pixels out of several million on the screen, Koch said.
        
        “Imagine you have to infer who loves whom, who backstabs whom, what’s going on from just those few pixels,” he said. “That’s the situation you have had in neuroscience until recently. You record from a handful of neurons and try to infer some common principles.”
        
        Researchers on the Observatory team are now looking at tens of thousands of neurons as they fire in real time. As for those principles of computation? So far, there doesn’t seem to be a simple answer, Koch said.</p>

        <h2 id="structure">Structure of brain</h2>

        <p>The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species, and identifying common features is often difficult.[4] Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species.[5] Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species;[6] others distinguish "advanced" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates.[4]

            The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.[7]</p>
