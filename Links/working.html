    <center><h1>WORKING OF BRAIN</h1></center>

    <h1>How does a brain work</h1>

    <p>The brain sends and receives chemical and electrical signals throughout the body. Different signals control different processes, and your brain interprets each. Some make you feel tired, for example, while others make you feel pain.

        Some messages are kept within the brain, while others are relayed through the spine and across the body’s vast network of nerves to distant extremities. To do this, the central nervous system relies on billions of neurons (nerve cells).</p>

        <p>The brain works like a big computer. It processes information that it receives from the senses and body, and sends messages back to the body.</p>

        <h2>Basic working unit of the brain</h2>

        <p>The brain and the rest of the nervous system are composed of many different types of cells, but the primary functional unit is a cell called the neuron. All sensations, movements, thoughts, memories, and feelings are the result of signals that pass through neurons.</p>

        <h2>Basic working cell of the brain</h2>

        <p>The central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord) is made up of two basic types of cells: Neurons, the nerve cells that send and receive signals. Glia, cells that provide structure in the brain.</p>

        <h2>Facts about workin of brain</h2>

        <p>Brain information travels up to an impressive 268 miles per hour. When a neuron is stimulated, it generates an electrical impulse that travels from cell to cell. A disruption in this regular processing can cause an epileptic seizure. On average, your spinal cord stops growing at 4 years old.</p>

        <h2 id="work">What makes the brain work</h2>

        <p>The brain and the rest of the nervous system are composed of many different types of cells, but the primary functional unit is a cell called the neuron. All sensations, movements, thoughts, memories, and feelings are the result of signals that pass through neurons.</p>

        <h2 id="lobes">Lobes of the brain</h2>

        <p>The brain's hemispheres have four lobes. The frontal lobes help control thinking, planning, organizing, problem-solving, short-term memory and movement. The parietal lobes help interpret feeling, known as sensory information. The lobes process taste, texture and temperature.</p>

        <p>Each brain hemisphere (parts of the cerebrum) has four sections, called lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Each lobe controls specific functions.

        </p>

        <h2 id="function">Lobes and their functions</h2>

        <p>Frontal lobe. The largest lobe of the brain, located in the front of the head, the frontal lobe is involved in personality characteristics, decision-making and movement. Recognition of smell usually involves parts of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe contains Broca’s area, which is associated with speech ability.
            Parietal lobe. The middle part of the brain, the parietal lobe helps a person identify objects and understand spatial relationships (where one’s body is compared with objects around the person). The parietal lobe is also involved in interpreting pain and touch in the body. The parietal lobe houses Wernicke’s area, which helps the brain understand spoken language.
            Occipital lobe. The occipital lobe is the back part of the brain that is involved with vision.
            Temporal lobe. The sides of the brain, temporal lobes are involved in short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm and some degree of smell recognition.</p>

            <h2 id="power">Power of brain</h2>

            <p>Your brain is faster and more powerful than a supercomputer.

                You have only seconds to act. Accessing the signals coming from your eyes, your brain quickly calculates when, where, and at what speed you will need to dive to intercept her. Then it orders your muscles to do so.</p>


                <h2 id="improve">improving of brain</h2>

                <p>There are many things that you can do to keep your brain in shape, such as doing crossword puzzles or Sudoku, reading, playing cards or putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Consider it cross-training your brain. Incorporate different types of activities to increase the effectiveness.</p>
